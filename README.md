# Consumer Price Index Analysis
# What is CPI?
Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis involves tracking the average price change over time for a basket of goods and services typically consumed by households. It serves as a primary measure of inflation, which helps companies and governments understand purchasing power trends, inflationary pressures, and economic stability.
## Project Overview:
This project analyzes the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to understand inflation trends across India. By visualizing CPI changes over time, identifying seasonal patterns, and comparing sectors, this analysis provides a comprehensive view of price dynamics in rural and urban areas, particularly during economic events like COVID-19.

## Features
1) Inflation Trend Analysis: Displays overall CPI trends over time.
2) Seasonal Decomposition: Breaks down CPI data into trend, seasonal, and residual components to identify cyclical patterns.
3) Sector Comparison: Compares inflation across sectors (e.g., Urban, Rural) for a deeper understanding of cost-of-living impacts.
4) COVID-19 Impact Analysis: Analyzes changes in essential categories (e.g., health, housing) during the COVID-19 period.

## Technologies Used
-) Python Libraries:
1) Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
2) Plotly for interactive visualizations
3) Statsmodels for time series decomposition

## Conclusion:
The key findings from the CPI analysis are as follows:

1) Overall Inflation Trend: There has been a steady increase in the CPI over the past decade, with inflation particularly rising after 2020.
2) Minimal Seasonal Effect: The seasonal decomposition shows minimal seasonal fluctuations, indicating that CPI trends are mainly driven by long-term factors.
3) Rural vs. Urban Impact: Inflation levels are consistent across rural, urban, and combined sectors, suggesting uniform price changes in these regions.
4) Sectoral Correlations: High correlations are observed between sectors like housing, transport, and miscellaneous, indicating their significant impact on overall inflation, while categories like eggs and vegetables show more independent price movements.
5) Sector-Specific Trends: Fuel and light have experienced the steepest price increase, especially post-2020, while health and housing show steady inflation growth. Cereals and products display more volatility.
6) COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021): During the pandemic, fuel prices initially dropped due to lower demand, then surged in 2021. Health and housing sectors saw consistent price increases, reflecting inflationary pressures on essential services during this period.
